title: "Between Video and Written Tutorials"
---

As someone who considers himself as a technologist in the general sense, I often find myself learning about new technology via tutorials online. There are two main ways that these knowledge and practical experiences are obtained. First, by going through video courses via online learning sites such as Udemy, Pluralsight and even YouTube. This has the advantage of being "easy" to consume but the major drawback is the time it requires to be invested. This brings me to the second method which is via written tutorials in the form of articles, documentations and blog posts. While not as easy as the first method, I do find it quicker.
