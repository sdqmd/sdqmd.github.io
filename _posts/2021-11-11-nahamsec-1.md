This post documents the notes taken during Nahamsec's Twitch stream on 14th July 2019.

[Live Bug Bounty Recon Session on Yahoo (Part 1 - 7/14/2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIujSpuDtFY)

The method shared relates to manually search for subdomains of the target's host. It requires using two public web services i.e. crt.sh and certspotter.com.

```bash
1) https://crt.sh
2) 
```

```bash
%.yahoo.com
```

```bash
certspotter.com
```

```bash
github.com/nahamsec/recon_profile
```

```bash
certspotter(){ 
curl -s https://certspotter.com/api/v0/certs\?domain\=$1 | jq '.[].dns_names[]' | sed 's/\"//g' | sed 's/\*\.//g' | sort -u | grep $1
}
```

```bash
certspotter(){
	curl -s https://api.certspotter.com/v1/issuances\?domain\=$1\&expand\=dns_names | jq '.[].dns_names' | sed 's/\"//g' | sed 's/\*.//g' | sort -u | grep $1
}
```

put into bash_profile

```bash
certspotter yahoo.com
```

```bash
certspotter yahoo | wc -l
```

grab the interesting subdomains

```bash
https://crt.sh/?q=%25api%25.yahoo.com
